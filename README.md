# ECG Delineator

This is the final Project of `Design of Biomedical Measurement Systems` course(NTUST 109.2).

This project implements the algorithm in [A Modular Low-Complexity ECG Delineation Algorithm for Real-Time Embedded Systems | IEEE Journals & Magazine | IEEE Xplore](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7858735)

## Feature

1. Web UI implement with React.js.
2. Use Trianswer for ECG signal.
3. Use BLE to communication.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
